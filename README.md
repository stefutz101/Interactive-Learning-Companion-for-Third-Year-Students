# Interactive Learning Companion for Third-Year Students
This project is an AI-driven educational tool designed to assist third-year university students by answering questions related to their course materials. The application leverages a fine-tuned version of the codellama/CodeLlama-7b-hf model, specifically trained on PDFs and PPTs from the university curriculum, to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers.

## Key Features
- Automated Question Generation and Answering: Uses AI to generate questions and answers from course materials, enhancing study efficiency.
- Multi-Mode Input: Supports text, SQL, and JSON modes for diverse query types.
- Performance Monitoring: Measures model accuracy and performance over time to ensure continuous improvement.
- Accessible Interface: Live on Hugging Face platform with a user-friendly chat interface.
  
## Technologies Used
- Python: For backend processing and model training.
- Hugging Face Transformers: For deploying pre-trained and fine-tuned language models.
- FastAPI: To build the API serving the model.
- Docker: To ensure consistency across development and production environments.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For building a responsive and interactive front-end interface.

## System Requirements
- GPU: Nvidia with Ampere Architecture (e.g., A100) for efficient model training.
- Cloud Hosting: Utilizes Hugging Face Spaces for deployment.

## Performance
- Training Time: 3 epochs with 348 steps on an A100 GPU took 00:45:58.
- Cost: Running the instance costs 11.34 points/h, totaling approximately $1.8 per session.
- Accuracy: Achieved 99% accuracy during testing with 500 randomly selected entries.

## Limitations
Server Resources: The current server has limited resources, resulting in a response time of approximately 20 minutes per query.

## How to Use
1. Visit the Website: Navigate to the live application hosted on Hugging Face.
2. Select Input Mode: Choose between text, SQL, and JSON modes.
3. Submit Queries: Enter your questions and receive detailed answers generated by the AI model.
4. Review Results: View the answers directly on the interface.
